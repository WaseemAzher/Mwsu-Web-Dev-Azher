Display technologies in smartphones of today come in two main types:<br>

Those based on LCDs (IPS technology and its variations)<br>
Those based on LEDs (AMOLED or Super AMOLED and its variations)<br>
LCD vs LED<br>
On an LCD-based display, there is a backlight that is shining through some polarizers, and it is shining through some filters. And by <br>manipulating the crystal display, you can see a boatload of different colors on the other side. What this means in simple terms is that the <br>light is not being generated by the display itself; it is being generated by the light behind the display, and only some of it is coming from the other side.<br>

Now, on an LED-based display, the light-emitting-diodes are doing all the magic. All the pixels that you can or cannot see are being emitted by these minuscule light-emitting-diodes (also know as LEDs and they produce red, green, and blue colors).<br>

Over here, it is the display itself that is generating the different and vibrant colors. The advantage of AMOLED or Super AMOLED displays over <br>its IPS LCD counterparts is that when a pixel is off and you can see a black color, it is not using up any battery, which is why smartphones <br>that feature AMOLED displays are more efficient in delivering extended periods of battery life.<br>

With an LCD display, however, if youâ€™re seeing black, the crystal display is being manipulated so that none of the light gets through. However, the light behind the display is still being generated meaning that the smartphone will be using small bits of the battery.
