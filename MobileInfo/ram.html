But the question here is it necessary of having more ram??<br><br>
        The answer to the question is NO!!!!!..Ram is like a carrier and soc is reciever If soc can't recieve more info then its of no use.
        Having more ram in the device isn't sufficient but having more speed processing ram is required Sounds confusing right..
        See along with the technology ram storages are developed simultaneously where different versions of rams are available that obviously means latest ram equals more speed..The relationship is simple with the soc and ram ..its like a post man gathering info from source to destination ...speed differs if he travels through cycle or by a Bike...now the storage depends on how much info he can handle through his journey thus it also effects speed....Whereas if he handles 8gb storage at once but reciver cant process that much info i.e. the Soc ..So More storage isn't enough but speed with enough storage is required though.<br><br>
        
        
       Most mobile devices are shipped with LPDDR3 or LPDDR4, while some high-end smartphones are shipped with LPDDR4X RAM. ‘LP’ stands for ‘Low-Power,’ and it reduces the total voltage of these chips, making them highly efficient and giving mobile phones the extended battery life.<br><br>

LPDDR4 is more efficient and powerful than LPDDR3, while LPDDR4X is the holy grail of RAM, resulting in unprecedented speeds and efficiency. LPDDR4X is more expensive to produce though, which is why you only see them in flagship smartphones. When newer generations of RAM are going to be introduced, such as LPDDR5, then you guys will see the flourishing of LPDDR4X memory in mid-ranged devices.
