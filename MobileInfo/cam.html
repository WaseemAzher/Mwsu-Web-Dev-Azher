The sensor (which detects light)
The lens (the component in which light comes through)
The image processor
While the megapixels on the smartphone are still an important part of the camera, it carries less importance than it did a while back. Instead, the primary limiting factor is the camera sensor of the phone and how sensitive it is when light passes through the lens.<br><br>

Remember, each sensor behaves very differently in a different smartphone, so every single image or video that you capture will be a variation of contrast, color accuracy, saturation and several others compared to a different handset. Most camera apps have manual settings so you can capture an image or video based on your own settings, but most devices donâ€™t have such an extended list of controls.<br><br>

        Now a days it became a trend in smartphone companys of providing dual cameras on either side of the device...
        Depending on the type of secondary camera used, a dual camera can help you get a sharper image with more details, enable an ultra-wide angle mode or simply help you take photos with a shallow depth of field to make the subject stand out.
        This increases the depth of the image captured making it more clear and allows loss less zoom..<br>
