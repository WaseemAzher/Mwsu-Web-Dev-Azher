                Even many of us follow others opinion in buying stuff or devices whereas we should be studying on our own to know much better on what we are spending.<br>
                Well the first thing i want to do is to remove all the stereotypes that are formed in you by any other means.<br>
            At first, Let me make this clear that no smartphone is good or bad according to their Branding or manufacturer.<br>
            Nor it is like that <em><strong>"The Higher you pay the better you get"</strong></em>..<br>
        Its just simply picking what you require ,which one suites your budget and Which is worthy to the price paying for it.<br>
        So, the main question is If one manufacturer with same product specification is selling its device for lets say 70,000rs and the other for 30,000rs...then why this high price difference Right?<br>
            The answer to this is every manufacturer has to come up with the expenditure of thier emloyees ,raw material,advertising,producing cost,as well as profit etcetra......<br>
        So, it varies from manufacturer to manufacturer according to their expenses. The good thing is if the product specification is same then the performance and every thing would never change....<em><br><strong>Then why pay more?? </strong></em>...<br>
            So, No branding is necessary for a smartphone being good.
